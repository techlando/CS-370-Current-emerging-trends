# Project Work

For this class, I worked on building a pirate-themed intelligent agent using reinforcement learning and neural networks. I was provided with starter code that handled some of the environment setup and basic structure for the agent’s interactions. From there, I created my own code to implement the learning logic, including how the agent made decisions, updated its policy, and improved its performance over time. I also adjusted parameters, tested different strategies, and refined the implementation to achieve stronger results.

# Connection to Computer Science

This project connects to the larger field of computer science because it demonstrates how intelligent systems can learn and adapt to real-world problems through experience. Computer scientists design and implement systems that solve complex problems, often in ways that improve efficiency, safety, or accessibility. In this case, reinforcement learning showed how an agent can learn from trial and error to maximize its goals, which is the same type of logic applied in robotics, finance, and many other industries.

# Problem-Solving as a Computer Scientist

When I approach a problem as a computer scientist, I start by breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts. For this project, that meant understanding the environment, identifying the goals of the agent, and then experimenting with algorithms to reach those goals. Iteration, testing, and analyzing results were key steps in refining the solution. This same approach applies across software development and system design, where problems are solved through structured logic, creativity, and testing.

# Ethical Responsibilities

As a computer scientist, I recognize that my work impacts both the end user and the organization. My ethical responsibilities include ensuring that the systems I design are fair, secure, and respectful of user privacy. It also means building solutions that are reliable and transparent, so users understand how decisions are made. For organizations, it’s important to balance innovation with responsibility, making sure technology serves people effectively and ethically.
